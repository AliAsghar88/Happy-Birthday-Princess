        What I Learned From Falling in Love With You
    </header>
    <main class="px-5 leading-loose font-sans text-xl">
        Falling in love with you has taught me more than I ever could have imagined. Itâ€™s been a journey of
        discovery not just about you, but about myself and the way love can transform everything.
        <br>
        Because of you, Iâ€™ve learned what it truly means to listen deeply, and to open my heart without fear. Iâ€™ve learned that love is about trust and showing our vulnerable sides to each other, and in the beautiful possibilities that await us. True love endures long distances and grows stronger when both of us fear God and wait for the right moment to avoid what counts as sin regardless of our desires. Our love is so beautiful yr because itâ€™s free of expectations and we have accepted each other just as we are. Youâ€™ve taught me to believe in the power of partnership and the strength that comes from standing together through every challenge.
        <br>
        Falling for you has made me more hopeful, more grateful, and more willing to embrace vulnerability. Your
        presence inspires me to grow. The way you motivate me when I don't want to code is so sweet yr and it makes me realize how lucky I am to have a girl like you. Most of all, Iâ€™ve learned that love is a gift, a blessing that changes who you are and who you want to become. Because of you, I am a better person, filled with more joy, courage, and hope for the future.
