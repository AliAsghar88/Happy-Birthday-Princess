        The Little Things You Do That I Notice
    </header>
    <main class="px-5 leading-loose font-sans text-xl">
        Itâ€™s often the little things you do that touch my heart, everyday moments that speak volumes about the love and care you carry within you. I notice the gentle smile you give when you think Iâ€™m not looking, the way you remember the smallest details about me, and the way your presence alone can make everything seem better.
        <br>
        I notice how you put in effort and remember the important things about me, those moments when you control your anger when I insist on your pictures or voice notes, and the way you support me during my hard days. These simple acts arenâ€™t small to me they are the language of your love written in kindness. They remind me every day that I am seen and deeply loved.
        <br>
        You create a safe space where love grows naturally. The little things you do build the foundation of our relationship and make me feel closer to you each day. They give me comfort, strength, and happiness, and I am grateful beyond words for every one of them.
