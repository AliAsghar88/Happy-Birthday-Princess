        Compliments You Ever Gave Me
    </header>
    <main class="px-5 leading-loose font-sans text-xl">
        I want to take a moment to tell you how much your words have meant to me those compliments youâ€™ve given me that
        go beyond the surface and touch the very core of my heart. Every time you speak kindly about me, it lifts me up
        in ways I canâ€™t fully express.
        <br>
        You have this incredible way of making me feel handsome. When you say I inspire you, or that you believe
        in me, it fills me with a newfound confidence and motivation. Your faith in who I am and who I can become gives
        me strength to push forward even when things get tough. And those cute nicknames you call me always go straight to my heart and make me feel truly special.
        <br>
        The compliments and nicknames youâ€™ve shared are not just words, they are a reflection of the deep love and respect you have for me. They remind me that I am enough, that I am worthy, and that I am truly loved. Your praise for my
        efforts, my character, and even the little things I do makes every day brighter.
        <br>
        I hold onto those moments when you tell me Iâ€™m your safe place, your partner, your joy. They are the sweetest
        gifts, and I want you to know they give me more happiness than you might ever realize.
