        Something Iâ€™ve Learned from You
    </header>
    <main class="px-5 leading-loose font-sans text-xl">
        There are countless things Iâ€™ve learned since you came into my life, but today I want to share some of the most
        precious lessons youâ€™ve taught me, lessons that have changed me in ways I never expected.
        <br>
        From you, Iâ€™ve learned the true meaning of patience and kindness. Your gentle spirit and understanding heart
        have shown me how to approach the world with more compassion not just towards others, but towards myself as
        well. Youâ€™ve taught me that love is not just about grand gestures but about the small efforts, everyday acts of care and respect that build a lasting bond.
        <br>
        Youâ€™ve shown me the strength in vulnerability, the courage to open up with someone, to share fears and dreams without judgment. Because of you, Iâ€™ve found the bravery to be more honest and real, to trust in love and in us more
        deeply than I ever thought possible.
        <br>
        Iâ€™ve learned how to appreciate the beauty in the little things the quiet moments we share, the soft laughter,
        the unspoken understanding that flows between us. Youâ€™ve helped me see that happiness isnâ€™t just in the big
        milestones, but in the simple presence of someone who truly cares.
        <br>
        Most of all, youâ€™ve taught me what it means to love selflessly and wholeheartedly. Your love inspires me every
        day to be better, to give more, and to appreciate every moment with you.
        <br>
        You're my greatest teacher, my guiding light, and the love that continues to shape who I am.
