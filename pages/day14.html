        What I Look Forward to
    </header>

        When I think about the future, the first thing that comes to mind is you. I look forward to all the moments weâ€™ve yet to share, the quiet mornings, the laughter-filled evenings when I come home, and the countless adventures waiting just around the corner. I want to hold you close as we sleep, and for you to hold me too, so I can pamper you and adore you with so much love reflected in my eyes just for you. After our nikkah, I donâ€™t want you to ever feel sad, and I will make sure of that.
        <br>
        I dream of building a life together, filled with love and joy that grows deeper every day. I see us supporting
        each other through every challenge, celebrating every success, and creating memories that will last a lifetime.
        I look forward to holding your hand through all the unknowns, knowing that as long as weâ€™re together, anything
        is possible.
        <br>
        There are so many simple things I want to share with you like traveling to new places, trying new experiences, and
        making ordinary days feel extraordinary just by being by your side. I imagine a future where we continue to
        inspire, encourage, and uplift each other, always reaching for the dreams that sparkle in our hearts.
        <br>
        Most of all, I look forward to continuing to fall more in love with you with each passing day, discovering new
        reasons to smile, new ways to care, and new depths to this beautiful bond we share.
        <br>
        Sweetheart you're my greatest dream and my most cherished hope. The future is brighter because itâ€™s with you.
