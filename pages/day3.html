        Your Eyes full of Depth

        Whenever I look into your eyes, I feel like Iâ€™m gazing into a world no map could ever chart. Thereâ€™s a depth in your eyes that pulls me in a mystery sparkling with emotion, memories, and silent stories. Sometimes itâ€™s like
        watching gentle waves over a deep ocean. sometimes, they shine with a secret light, hinting at dreams you havenâ€™t spoken aloud.

        There are moments when your eyes reflect so much warmth, joy, curiosity, even a playful glimmer that makes me smile. But what stays with me most is the way your eyes make me feel understood, safe, and truly seen. In your
        gaze, I find comfort and excitement all at once a promise that thereâ€™s always more to discover, both in you and in us.

        Looking into your eyes reminds me why I fell for you every glance is a new adventure, and every expression reveals another beautiful layer of your soul. Thank you for letting me in, for sharing your depths, for letting
        your eyes speak the words your lips sometimes canâ€™t.
