        Your Cutu si Nose

        I want to tell you how much I adore your cute nose. It might sound simple, but every little detail about
        you carries a world of meaning for me and your nose is no exception. I love how it crinkles when you laugh and
        how the tip turns a little pink when it’s cold or when you blush.

        There’s something irresistibly sweet about the way your nose fits your face like it was created for your smiles,
        for the kisses I want to give, and for the expressions that make you, you. When I look at you, sometimes I
        catch myself just wanting to softly trace its outline or boop it playfully, because it feels like the center of
        so many adorable moments we share.

        To me, your nose is a little reminder that beauty is in the details, that love sees charm in every curve, every quirk, every “imperfection” that’s really just perfect because it’s yours.

        Your nose is just one of the countless reasons I adore you, head to toe.
