        Apology from you

        I want to begin by saying how truly sorry I am. If Iâ€™ve ever hurt you or disappointed you, please know it was
        never my intention. I may be not the best boyfriend in the world but I can bet that no one can love you more than me Mrs Ali Asghar.
        <br>
        Iâ€™ve been reflecting on my actions and words, and I realize how much I want to do better for you. You
        mean the world to me, and it hurts to think I may have caused any distance between us or you cried because of me. Please forgive me for the moments Iâ€™ve fallen short, for the times I didnâ€™t listen as well as I should have, or for the ways I could have shown you more patience and understanding.
        <br>
        Our love is too precious to let mistakes come between us. I promise to learn, to grow, and to be more mindful of
        your feelings. I want to be the partner you deserve, the one who lifts you up, supports you, and loves you
        unconditionally through every high and low.
