        How I see Your Face
    </header>
    <main class="px-5 leading-loose font-sans text-xl">
        Every time I look at your face, it's like seeing sunlight through my window on a rainy day. Your eyes sparkle with gentle kindness and a little attraction that always draws me in. Your smile lines can light up my entire mood, no matter how dark my day feels.
        <br>
        When you laugh, your cheeks glow, It's one of the moments I always want to remember. Your expressions are honest and so full of life. I find it impossible to look away. To me, you arenâ€™t just beautiful you are warmth, comfort, and home.
        <br>
        Sometimes, I catch myself staring, completely lost in the details, the way your eyelashes flutter, the softness of your skin, the way your eyes seem to tell a story all their own. You are art to me every angle, every freckle, every grin.
        <br>
        If I had to describe how I see your face in one word, I would choose "precious." Because that's what you are to me.
