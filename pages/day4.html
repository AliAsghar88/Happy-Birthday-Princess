        Your Beautiful Ears
    </header>
    <main class="px-5 leading-loose font-sans text-xl">
        You know why I love your ears ? because they are the only ones that wants to listen to me. I don't think anyone else talks about their girlfriend's ears but I adore yours because of the way you listen to me and always gives me a comfot place. They might be small, but to me, they carry so much meaning. I love the way they peek out from behind your hair.
        <br>
        Your ears are where I whisper secrets, just between us, and where you listen so patiently to all my stories, hopes, and silly jokes. I am so grateful for the way you truly listen with your heart as much as your ears. Itâ€™s a quiet kind of beauty, one that makes me feel heard, cherished, and accepted.
        <br>
        Sometimes, when the world is loud and overwhelming, I imagine my words softly reaching you, bringing you comfort. I love the intimacy we share, whispering little nothings or sweet words close to your ear. Itâ€™s in those moments that I feel most connected to you.
        <br>
        Thank you for listening to me, with your heart, and to the love we share. Your beautiful ears are a symbol of how deeply you care, and how lucky I am to have someone who listens so patiently and loves so sincerely.
