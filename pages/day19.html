        What Love Means to Me Because of You
    </header>
    <main class="px-5 leading-loose font-sans text-xl">
        Before you came into my life, love was just a word something I never understood properly and had never truly felt.
        But because of you, love has become so much more valuable in my eyes because you told me what actual love looks like. You have shown me that love is not just a feeling but a beautiful journey filled with kindness, patience, and unwavering support at every stage of life.
        <br>
        Because of you, Iâ€™ve learned that love means truly seeing someone not just their smile or their beauty, but
        their hopes, fears, and dreams, appreciating every part of them, especially the parts that make them uniquely
        themselves. Youâ€™ve taught me that love is about choosing to be there, through the laughter and the tears,
        through every high and every low.
        <br>
        Love means finding joy in the little things, your laughter that brightens my darkest days, your voice that comforts me like no other sound in the world. It means growing together, learning from each other, and building a bond that only gets stronger with time.
        <br>
        Because of you, love is no longer just a word; itâ€™s the life we create together, filled with hope, trust, and endless dreams.
        <br>
        Thanks for teaching me what real love is and for being the love that I will always hold closest to my heart.
