        Henna on your Hands
    </header>
    <main class="px-5 leading-loose font-sans text-xl">
        There is something truly enchanting about the henna on your hands. Every line and delicate curve tells
        a story of beauty, because of the pretty designs you choose.
        <br>
        When I see the deep, stain of henna on your skin, it reminds me of my love for you. In many cultures, henna is
        said to symbolize not just decoration but blessings of prosperity,
        health, and deep connection. Some say the darker the henna's color, the stronger the love it represents, and I
        feel that truth every time I look at your hands.
        <br>
        Your hands, already stunning on their own, become a living canvas of art and meaning. When I see my name on your
        hands hayeee they remind me that I am also special for someone, there's someone who adore me who loves me
        without any condition and without any reason.
        <br>
        You wear your henna like a crown of tradition, it makes me feel proud and grateful. They tell the world a story
        of love and the
        timeless bond we share.
