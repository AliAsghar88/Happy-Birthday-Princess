        I want to make you a promise from the deepest part of my heart that I will always try to make you smile, provide you everything your deserve, even if it means sacrificing myself. I will always put efforts so that your inner child alive, never kill your excitement, and honor you with all my heart. I promise to be by your side through every joy and challenge, and to hold your hand tightly no matter where life leads us.
        <br>
        I promise to love you with patience and kindness, to listen with an open heart, and to speak words that build you up and make you feel treasured every day. I am promising to always respect your thoughts, your feelings, and your beautiful soul with complete loyalty, never taking for granted the precious gift of your love.
        <br>
        In you, I have found my closest friend, my greatest comfort, and the most incredible love. I pledge to nurture what we have with honesty and faithfulness, to laugh with you in moments of happiness, and to stand strong with you in times of hardship (can be related to child birth or anything else) always remember, I will never let you feek weak in any situation or feel useless about yourself like you do which is wrong because your worth is way more than everything else in my life after my parents.
        <br>
        This is my promise to you: to be true and devoted, to give you my best self, and to love you more deeply with each passing day. Together, I know we can build a future filled with hope, warmth, and endless love.
