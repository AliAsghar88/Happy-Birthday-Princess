        Every day with you is a gentle reminder of how much I can grow, dream, and become. In your presence, I feel a strength rise in me that I never knew I had a belief that I can be better, kinder, and more courageous. You inspire confidence, You show me that hope is something you carry even on the hardest days.
        <br>
        You inspire me to see beauty in the smallest things. Because of you, I want to try new things, embrace challenges, and never let my fears hold me back because you trust me and will be on my side no matter what my situation is, so that I can fail again and again to achieve big. You make me want to be the kind of person who deserves a heart as wonderful as yours.
        <br>
        You inspire me to push past limits, to trust myself, and to keep believing in whatâ€™s possible. Thank you for waking up a whole new world inside me, a world filled with passion, hope, and quiet strength.
        <br>
        Most of all, you inspire me to love honestly, openly, and without hesitation. Every day, I am grateful for the light you bring into my life, and I promise to keep growing alongside you, inspired by your love.
