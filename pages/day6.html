        Your Attractive Lips
    </header>
    <main class="px-5 leading-loose font-sans text-xl">
        I want to tell you how much I’m captivated by your lips and your beautiful voice.
        <br>
        There’s something so special about your lips the way they curve into a soft smile, the gentle way you say my
        name specially "Mere Ali". I always notice the subtle ways your lips move when you laugh, whisper, or even when you’re lost in thought. To me, your lips are the source of so many moments: kisses in snaps, the smiles, the words that make my heart flutter.
        <br>
        And then there’s your voice. The sound of it is music to me. Whether you’re telling me a story, laughing out
        loud, singing a song just for me, or simply saying “Assalam o alaikum” your voice brings me comfort and happiness like nothing else. It’s warm and familiar, soothing my worries even on the hardest days. Sometimes, I close my eyes just to listen to the way
        your laughter fills a room, or the softness in your voice when you tell me you love me.
        <br>
        Your lips and your voice are magic to me. They speak kindness, love, and joy into my world. I feel so lucky that
        each word, each laugh comes from you.
