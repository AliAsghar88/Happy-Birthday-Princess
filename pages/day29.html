        I want to thank you for simply being you. Your presence in my life is a gift more precious than words can capture. The unique light you bring, your genuine kindness, your laughter, and your unwavering love make everything better just by being.
        <br>
        Thank you for your authenticity, for never pretending to be anyone else but the beautiful soul I fell in love
        with. Itâ€™s your realness, your strengths, and even your imperfections that make you so wonderfully special. You
        donâ€™t just fill my life with joy but you make me appreciate the true meaning of love and acceptance.
        <br>
        Thank you for the little things you do that often go unseen but never unnoticed the way you listen, the way you
        care, and the way you make me feel safe and valued. My angry wifey looks more cute yr "jannat ki hur bilkul" 
        <br>
        Most of all, thank you for loving me just as I am and allowing me to love you deeply in return. With you, Iâ€™ve
        found a partner, a best friend, and a forever home.
        <br>
        I love you for everything you are and everything youâ€™ll ever be.
