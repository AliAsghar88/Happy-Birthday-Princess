        How Youâ€™ve Changed My Life
    </header>
    <main class="px-5 leading-loose font-sans text-xl">
        Before you came into my life, I never fully understood how a person could make you love yourself, because of you I now love myself. Now I am not insecure about my looks anymore like I was before. Youâ€™ve changed my world in ways I never imagined, bringing light to the darkest days, hope to moments of doubt, and a love so deep it fills every corner of my heart.
        <br>
        With you, Iâ€™ve learned to see the beauty in the little things and to appreciate every moment as a gift. You inspire me to be better every day not just for myself, but for us, for the future weâ€™re building together.
        <br>
        When I look back, I see a clear line between the life I had before you and the life I live now a life full of joy, passion, and endless possibilities. Your love has opened my heart in ways I never thought possible, helping
        me heal, grow, and dream bigger than ever.
