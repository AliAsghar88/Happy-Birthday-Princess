        Your Smile Melts Me Every Time
    </header>
    <main class="px-5 leading-loose font-sans text-xl">
        Thereâ€™s a kind of magic in your smile, one that never fails to melt me, no matter where we are or how Iâ€™m feeling. I could be having the toughest day, but the moment I hear your laugh and imagine your lips curving into that beautiful smile, all my worries dissolve.
        <br>
        Your smile is warmth on a cold morning, sunlight spilling through my heart. Itâ€™s the gentle spark that lights up every part of my world. The way your eyes crinkle, the way your cheeks glow, the way laughter just bubbles up, all of it draws me in, again and again. Sometimes, I canâ€™t help but sit and stare, hoping your happiness will rub off on me. It always does.
        <br>
        When you smile at me, I feel so seen, so special like thereâ€™s something in me worth making happy. Your smile is my safe place, my joy, my favorite view in any crowd. I wish I could bottle that feeling forever, just to open it whenever I need a little extra love.
        <br>
        Thank you for gifting me the most precious thing in the world, your happiness, your smile, your light. I hope I can always give you reasons to smile, the way your smile gives me reasons to fall in love all over again.
